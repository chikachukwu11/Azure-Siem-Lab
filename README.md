# Azure-Siem-Lab
<h2>Description</h2>
This lab involves me building a cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) using a free Azure subscription and Microsoft Sentinel. The objective is to simulate a real-world environment where I can ingest security logs, analyze failed login attempts, and visualize attacker geolocation in near‑real time. By completing this lab, I learned how to set up cloud infrastructure, configure logging and SIEM tools, and create visual insights on attack activity—all within a controlled, self‑contained environment.
